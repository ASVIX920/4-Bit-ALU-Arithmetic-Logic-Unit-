# 4-Bit-ALU-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-
This repository implements a versatile 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog HDL for FPGA synthesis using Quartus. The ALU performs the following operations: 1) Bitwise OR 2) Bitwise AND 3) Signed/Unsigned Addition/Subtraction 4) Set Less than Signed

Key Features:

>Modular design for improved readability and maintainability.
>Comprehensive testbench for verification of all functionalities.
>Quartus project files for easy synthesis and simulation.

Target Users:

>Digital logic design enthusiasts.
>Computer architecture students.
>FPGA developers interested in building custom arithmetic units.

Future Enhancements:

>Implement additional ALU operations (e.g., shift left/right, carry flag output).
>Explore pipelining techniques for improved performance.
>Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive testing.


IMPORTANT SIDENOTE: The attached file "1BitAdder.bdf" is the design for the 1BitAdder blackbox included in the 4-bit ALU design. I've already uploaded the .bsf symbol file but you could also observe the real design.
